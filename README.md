# CampusFind - Quickly locate fellow employees and teammates

## The Problem

Have you ever spent valuable time searching for a teammate across a sprawling
institution? Phone calls and messages often interrupt workflows, while coordinating large teams quickly can feel impossible.

## The Solution

After having to spend hours looking for professors and heads of departments a
on busy days for signatures and permissions, I created an app where 
you can look up people in an institution with a couple taps on your mobile device!

## CampusFind offers a seamless way to

- **Instantly locate colleagues**: View real-time, interactive floor maps that guide you directly to your colleagues’ locations.
- **Set and update your location**: Easily share your whereabouts with others so they know where to find you.
- **View events and attendees**: See who's in each room or meeting space, and what events are taking place.
- **Utilize RFID stations**: Automate check-ins and check-outs for quick and efficient tracking of locations.
- **Display your availability**: Let others know when you’re available or busy, fostering more respectful and efficient collaboration.

## Installation

Institutions are created and users are added through the **CampusFind Admin Website**, which is currently under development. At this time, users cannot sign up directly from the Flutter app.

As such, a download link is unavailable until further updates.
