# CampusFind - Quickly locate fellow employees and teammates

## The Problem

Have you ever spent valuable time searching for a teammate across a sprawling
institution? Phone calls and messages often interrupt workflows, while coordinating large teams quickly can feel impossible.

## The Solution

After having to spend hours looking for professors and heads of departments a
on busy days for signatures and permissions, I created an app where 
you can look up people in an institution with a couple taps on your mobile device!

## CampusFind offers a seamless way to

- Instantly locate colleagues with real-time, interactive floor maps.  
- Set and update your own location with ease.  
- Look at the events and attendees in each room.  
- Use RFID stations for quick, automated check-ins and check-outs.  
- Display your availability status for efficient and respectful collaboration.  

## Installation

Institutions are to be created, and users added via the CampusFind Admin website which is currently under development. Users cannot be signed up from this Flutter app.

As such, a download link is currently unavailable
